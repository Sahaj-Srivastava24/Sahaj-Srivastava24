### Henlo 👋🏽

I'm Sahaj Srivastava, aka mad1ad. I'm a prefinal year CSE Major with a keen interest in the development and Cloud / Edge services. I like trying new technologies, reading blogs, and wondering about silly things. My skillset revolves around frontend development with languages like Typescript. Besides sticking my eyes onto the screen, I work out a bit, stress over things and go to bed late. 
  
**Personal Tech Updates**
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Elixir and exploring backend services.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on Full stack projects.
- 💬 Happy to help but don't ask how my code works.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'll probably fail this semester.
