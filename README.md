### Henlo 👋🏽

I'm Sahaj Srivastava, aka mad1ad. I'm a prefinal year CSE Major with keen interest in fields of development and Cloud / Edge services. I like to try out new technologies, read blogs and wonder about silly things. My skillset revolve around frontend development, with languages like Typescript. Beside's sticking my eyes onto the screen, I workout a bit, stress over things and go to bed late.
